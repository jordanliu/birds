## Getting Started

This current development build is mainly focused on iOS. To get started, start up the Simulator on your device then follow the instructions:

```
cd birds
flutter run
```

## Add New Birds

Currently birds are stored in an array in lib/birds.dart, simply add a new item to the array and the corresponding thumbnail of the bird in the assets/ folder. The preferred image of a thumbnail is a high quality transparent bird with a subtle shadow.
